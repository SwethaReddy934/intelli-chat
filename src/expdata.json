eighth to third centuries BCE saw a breakdown in the authority of the Zhou dynasty  accompanied by the emergence of administrative and military techniques  literature  philosophy  and historiography  In     BCE  China was unified under an emperor for the first time  Appointed non hereditary officials began ruling counties instead of the aristocracy  ushering in more than two millennia of imperial dynasties including the Qin  Han  Tang  Yuan  Ming  and Qing  With the invention of gunpowder and paper  the establishment of the Silk Road  and the building of the Great Wall  Chinese culture including languages  traditions  architecture  philosophy and technology flourished and has heavily influenced both its neighbors and lands further afield  However  China began to cede parts of the country in the late   th century to various European powers by a series of unequal treaties  After decades of struggle  the      Revolution resulted in the overthrow of the monarchy and the establishment of the Republic of China  ROC  the following year  The country under the nascent Beiyang government was unstable and ultimately fragmented during the Warlord Era  which was ended upon the Northern Expedition conducted by the Kuomintang  KMT  to reunify the country  The Chinese Civil War began in       when KMT forces purged members of the rival Chinese Communist Party  CCP   who proceeded to engage in sporadic fighting against the KMT led Nationalist government  Following the country s invasion by the Empire of Japan in       the KMT and CCP temporarily agreed to a truce in favor of a united front against the Japanese  The Second Sino Japanese War eventually ended in a Chinese victory  however  atrocities such as the Nanjing Massacre had a lasting impact on the country  The end of war with Japan in      was quickly followed by a resumption of hostilities between the KMT and CCP  In       the resurgent Communists established control over most of the country  proclaiming the People s Republic of China and forcing the Nationalist government to retreat to the island of Taiwan  The country was split  with both sides claiming to be the sole legitimate government of China  Following the implementation of land reforms  further attempts by the PRC to realize communism failed  the Great Leap Forward was largely responsible for the Great Chinese Famine that ended with millions of Chinese people having died  and the subsequent Cultural Revolution was a period of social turmoil and persecution characterized by Maoist populism  Following the Sino Soviet split  the Shanghai Communiqu  in      would precipitate the normalization of relations with the United States  Economic reforms that began in      led by reformists within the CCP moved the country away from a socialist planned economy towards an increasingly capitalist market economy  spurring significant economic growth  The corresponding movement for increased democracy and liberalization stalled after the Tiananmen Square protests and massacre in       China is a unitary one party socialist republic led by the CCP  It is one of the five permanent members of the UN

        "summary": "The Impact of prostitution on mental health refers to the psychological  cognitive  and emotional consequences experienced by individuals involved in prostitution  These consequences include a wide range of mental health issues and difficulties in emotional management and interpersonal relationships  Prostitution is closely linked to various psychological pathologies and affects not only those directly involved but also society at large  Studies have shown that both street and indoor sex workers have experienced high levels of abuse in childhood and adulthood  with differences in trauma rates between the two groups  Women in prostitution experience a profound impact on their identity  encompassing cognitive  physical  and emotional dimensions  manifesting in health problems and difficulties in emotional management and interpersonal relationships  Prostitution  being strongly linked to psychopathology and social health  should be addressed as a medical situation that affects not only the individuals involved but also society at large  with psychological aspects  Sex work involves the provision of one or more sexual services in exchange for money or goods  However  sex workers are not a homogeneous group  Street sex workers are often illegal  finding clients on the street and providing services in alleys or clients  cars  On the other hand  indoor sex workers operate in brothels  massage parlors  or as private escorts  Previous research has shown that both street and indoor sex workers have experienced high levels of abuse in childhood and adulthood  though indoor sex workers report lower rates of abuse and trauma compared to street workers  There is a high prevalence of victimization in childhood and adulthood among sex workers  with secondary trauma disorders  Recurrent victimization  known as  Type II trauma   can cause pathological psychological changes that are difficult to classify  Proposed diagnoses include developmental trauma disorder for childhood and complex post traumatic stress disorder  cPTSD  for adulthood  though these are not included in official diagnostic manuals  There is a connection between prostitution and trafficking  organized crimes that reflect sexism  patriarchy  capitalism  and economic inequality  The physical consequences of sexual exploitation include sexually transmitted diseases  cervical cancer  chronic pain  liver problems  unintended pregnancies  eating disorders  concentration and memory difficulties  visual and hearing problems  fractures  and  in extreme cases  death  Psychologically  women suffer from low self esteem  stress  pathological ties with control networks  social isolation  loneliness  extreme fear  hopelessness  and a lack of assertiveness in seeking support  resulting in trauma that alters their beliefs and perceptions  causing irreparable damage to their personal identity  These conditions are exacerbated by language barriers and other vulnerability factors  such as having suffered sexual abuse in childhood or being the main economic support for their family  which is exploited by pimps  The effects on mental health are severe  with high rates of depression  anxiety  and post traumatic stress disorder  PTSD  among those who sell sex  exacerbated by social stigma  discrimination  physical violence  and mistreatment by authorities  Studies in the United States and Canada reveal depression symptoms in     of these individuals and PTSD symptoms in nearly a third  showing higher rates than in combat veterans  Substance abuse is common  generally as a response to sex work rather than a cause  with most increasing drug use to cope with their reality  The sex industry is a global business worth     billion annually  with the United States hosting the largest number of adult clubs in the world  employing over         people  Between     and     of women in this industry were sexually abused during their childhood  These women have higher rates of substance abuse  sexually transmitted infections  domestic violence  depression  violent aggression  rape  and PTSD compared to the general population  The emotional effects of prostitution are devastating  Dissociation  a response to uncontrollable traumatic events  is common among prostituted individuals  similar to the response of prisoners of war  Research has shown that both indoor and outdoor sex work increase the risk of being assaulted  In outdoor sex work     of women reported being physically assaulted  and     reported being raped  In indoor settings  more sexual violence and threats with weapons were reported  Women in the sex industry frequently face multiple psychosocial stressors  limited resources  and a high rate of untreated health and legal problems  Other studies that assessed the presence of psychological alterations in prostitutes  compared to non prostitutes  also documented concentration and memory difficulties  as well as sleep problems  with an incidence of       irritability        anxiety        phobias        panic attacks        compulsions        obsessions        fatigue        and

country s first case of the disease on    January      in a resident of Kanagawa Prefecture who had returned from Wuhan  China  The first known death from COVID    was recorded in Japan on    February       Both were followed by a second outbreak introduced by travelers and returnees from Europe and the United States between    March      and    March       According to the National Institute of Infectious Diseases  the majority of viruses spreading in the country derive from the European type  while those of the Wuhan type began disappearing in March       On   October       the number of confirmed cases in Japan exceeded the number of confirmed cases in China  and at the end of the month  the number of confirmed cases in the country crossed the         mark  The number of confirmed cases in Japan also crossed the         mark on    December       the         mark on    January       the         mark on   February       the         mark on    April       the         mark on   May       the         mark on    May       the         mark on   July      and the         mark on    July       At the end of       there were about         COVID    cases in the country  nearly     times the number of COVID    cases in China  On    January       the first anniversary of the beginning of the COVID    pandemic in Japan was commemorated  It was two days after the number of confirmed cases in the country exceeded          On    April       the number of deaths in Japan crossed the        mark  The number of confirmed cases in the country exceeded the number of confirmed cases in Portugal on   August      and crossed the one million mark the following day  By the time the      Summer Paralympics ended  there were more than a million cases in Japan  On    September       the number of confirmed cases in the country exceeded the number of confirmed cases in the Czech Republic  More than a week later  on   October       the first anniversary of the day when the number of confirmed cases in Japan exceeded the number of confirmed cases in China  Tokyo is the most affected prefecture in Japan  with nearly         cases  The country also joined the list of    countries with the most COVID    cases on   January       a few months after becoming the most affected country in East Asia by overtaking China in terms of the number of infections  About seven months later  on    August       Japan joined the list of    countries with the most COVID    cases  a week after the number of confirmed cases in the country exceeded a million  On    September       Japan joined the list of    countries with the most COVID    cases  Five weeks later  on    October       the country left the list of    countries with the most COVID    cases  On a global scale  cases in Japan constitute about      of global cases  The COVID    vaccination in Japan began on    February       more than a month after the first anniversary of the beginning of the pandemic in the country was commemorated  As of    October       about      million people in Japan received at least one dose of the COVID    vaccine  while about      million were fully vaccinated  The Japanese government adopted various measures to limit or prevent the outbreak  Some observers describe this approach as constituting a unique  Japan Model  of COVID    response  On    January       former prime minister Shinzo Abe established the Japan Anti Coronavirus National Task Force to oversee the government s response to the pandemic  On    February       he requested the temporary closure of all Japanese elementary  junior high  and high schools until early April       On   April       Abe proclaimed a one month state of emergency for Tokyo and the prefectures of Kanagawa  Saitama  Chiba  Osaka  Hyogo  and Fukuoka  On    April       the declaration was extended to the rest of the country for an indefinite period  The state of emergency was lifted in an increasing number of prefectures during May       extending to the whole country by    May       On   January       Suga declared a state of emergency for Tokyo and the prefectures of Chiba  Saitama and Kanagawa  effective from   January until   February  Japan s death rate per capita from coronavirus is one of the lowest in the developed world  despite its aging population  Factors speculated to explain this include the government response  a milder strain of the virus  cultural habits such as bowing etiquette and wearing face masks  handwashing with sanitizing equipment  a protective genetic trait  and a relative immunity conferred by the mandatory BCG tuberculosis vaccine  In December       the Ministry of Health  Labour and Welfare reported the number of excess deaths through July  The excess death toll was       in COVID    and       from natural causes due to the aging of the population  but the death toll from pneumonia fell by      as a result of infection control measures taken by people  The pandemic continued to be a concern for the      Summer Olympics  Although the Japanese government and the International Olympic Committee negotiated its postponement until       reports concluded that a cancellation of the games was still an option   although prime minister Yoshihide Suga dismissed the idea of it happening  In the end  the Olympics went ahead  with sports events running between    July and   August      and multiple restrictions in place to avoid the breakouts of the virus ",

        "summary": "Adenovirus infection is a contagious viral disease  caused by adenoviruses  commonly resulting in a respiratory tract infection  Typical symptoms range from those of a common cold  such as nasal congestion  coryza and cough  to difficulty breathing as in pneumonia  Other general symptoms include fever  fatigue  muscle aches  headache  abdominal pain and swollen neck glands  Onset is usually two to fourteen days after exposure to the virus  A mild eye infection may occur on its own  combined with a sore throat and fever  or as a more severe adenoviral keratoconjunctivitis with a painful red eye  intolerance to light and discharge  Very young children may just have an earache  Adenovirus infection can present as a gastroenteritis with vomiting  diarrhoea and abdominal pain  with or without respiratory symptoms  However  some people have no symptoms  Adenovirus infection in humans are generally caused by Adenoviruses types B  C  E and F  Spread occurs mainly when an infected person is in close contact with another person  This may occur by either fecal oral route  airborne transmission or small droplets containing the virus  Less commonly  the virus may spread via contaminated surfaces  Other respiratory complications include acute bronchitis  bronchiolitis and acute respiratory distress syndrome  It may cause myocarditis  meningoencephalitis or hepatitis in people with weak immune systems  Diagnosis is by signs and symptoms  and a laboratory test is not usually required  In some circumstances  a PCR test on blood or respiratory secretions may detect adenovirus DNA  Other conditions that appear similar include whooping cough  influenza  parainfluenza  and respiratory syncytial virus  Adenovirus gastroenteritis appears similar to diarrhoeal diseases caused by other infections  Infection by adenovirus may be prevented by washing hands  avoiding touching own eyes  mouth and nose with unwashed hands  and avoiding being near sick people  A live vaccine to protect against types   and   adenoviruses has been used successfully in some military personnel  Management is generally symptomatic and supportive  Most adenovirus infections get better without any treatment  Medicines to ease pain and reduce fever can be bought over the counter  Adenovirus infections affect all ages  They occur sporadically throughout the year  and outbreaks can occur particularly in winter and spring  when they may spread more quickly in closed populations such as in hospitals  nurseries  long term care facilities  schools  and swimming pools  Severe disease is rare in people who are otherwise healthy  Adenovirus infection accounts for up to     of respiratory infections in children  Most cases are mild and by the age of    years  most children have had at least one adenovirus infection      of conjunctivitis cases are due to adenovirus infection  In       the Global Burden of Disease Study estimated that globally  around    million episodes of diarrhea among children under the age of five years  were attributable to adenovirus infection  The first adenoviral strains were isolated in      by Rowe et al   ",
